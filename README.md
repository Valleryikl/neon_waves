# 🎉 Neon Waves — Festival Website Project

**Neon Waves** is a multi-page website built to simulate a real festival landing page. It was created as part of my application project to join Web@cadémie. This site includes animated UI elements, a responsive layout, and a strong visual identity using HTML, CSS, SCSS and JavaScript.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎨 Bold neon-inspired design and branding
- 📱 Responsive layout for different screen sizes
- 📄 Multiple pages: Home, About, Contact, Gallery
- 🔁 JavaScript slider with smooth transitions
- 🧠 Fully written by hand — no frameworks

## 💡 Highlights

- Created as an entry project to **Web@cadémie**
- Focused on layout, animation, and multi-page design
- All visual effects (animations, hover states, sliders) built without libraries
